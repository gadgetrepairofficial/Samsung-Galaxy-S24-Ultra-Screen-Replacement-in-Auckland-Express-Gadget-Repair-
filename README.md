At Express Gadget Repair, we understand that your S24 Ultra is more than just a phone; it’s your office, your high-resolution camera, and your primary connection to the world. We don't believe in "cheap" fixes that compromise quality. We believe in Express service with Expert results.

1. Specialized S24 Ultra Technology Knowledge The S24 Ultra features a unique flat-screen design compared to its predecessors, but it houses incredibly sensitive sensors, including the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner and S-Pen digitizer. Our Auckland-based technicians are specifically trained in the architecture of the S24 series, ensuring that every internal component—from the 5,000mAh battery to the 200MP camera array—is protected during the repair.

2. Premium Quality Replacement Parts The magic of the S24 Ultra lies in its 120Hz refresh rate and peak brightness of 2,600 nits. We use only premium-grade replacement screens to ensure your display remains vibrant, the touch response stays lightning-fast, and your S-Pen glides with zero lag. We ensure the biometrics (fingerprint sensor) work perfectly after the glass is replaced.

3. True "Express" Service in Auckland We know you can't be without your device for days. While big-box retailers might send your phone away for weeks, Express Gadget Repair offers fast turnaround times right here in Auckland. We aim to get your S24 Ultra back in your hands as quickly as possible without ever rushing the precision of the bond.

4. Transparent Pricing & Local Trust We are a New Zealand-owned business with over 8 years of experience in the IT and repair industry. We offer competitive, honest pricing with no hidden fees. We even offer a warranty on our parts and labor, so you can walk out of our shop with total peace of mind.

Common S24 Ultra Issues We Resolve:
Shattered Front Glass: Even if the image is fine, cracked glass can lead to moisture damage.

OLED Bleeding: Black spots or "ink" spreading across the screen.

Touch Failure: Dead zones where the screen doesn't respond to your finger or S-Pen.

Display Lines: Vertical or horizontal lines caused by internal connector damage.

Flickering Screens: Usually caused by a hardware fault in the display panel.
